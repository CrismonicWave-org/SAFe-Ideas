# Maintenance of Markdown Ides

- I use VS Code as my preferred editor for manipulating and maintaning Markdown.
- I use the two following VS Code Extensions
  - [Markdown All in One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one)
    - In the Templates, you will see numbers and descriptions for the Table Of Contents.  To acomplish this, after installing the Plugin, I execute from the command pallete the command `sections` which will insert numbers into the \#\# Headers automatically and I set the Update TOC upon save.

    Edit away and your TOC should follow your document design.
  - [Markdown Lint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint)
    - I find this one helpful but certainly you can disable it.  I try to strictly use it.
